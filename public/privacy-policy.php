                email address as part of the buying and selling process. Additionally, when you browse our store, we
                automatically receive your computer&apos;s IP address to provide us with information about your browser
                and operating system.</p>

            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 capitalize lg:text-2xl">Section 2: Consent</h2>
            <p>When you provide personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order,
                arrange for a delivery, or return a purchase, we assume that you consent to us collecting and using that
                information only for that specific purpose.</p>
            <p>If we need to use your personal information for a secondary purpose, such as marketing, we will ask for
                your express consent or give you an opportunity to opt-out.</p>
            <p>You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at the provided email or mailing address.</p>

                and our payment gateway follows the standards set by the PCI Security Standards Council.</p>
            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 capitalize lg:text-2xl">Section 5: Third-Party Services</h2>
